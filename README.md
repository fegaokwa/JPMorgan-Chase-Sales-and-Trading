Markets (Sales and Trading) Virtual Internship
</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
The virtual markets internship provided by JPMorgan introduces typical projects expected of a JPMorgan Sales & Trading team member. There are two themes focused on in this virtual internship, they are:
<br />
 <dl>
  <dt>Analysis</dt>
  <dd>- analyzing prospective clients for JPMorgan products; and attractive investment opportunities for current clients</dd>
  <dt>Pitching</dt>
  <dd>- to internal stakeholders on prospective clients; and to clients the robust offering of JPMorgan products </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Summary</h2>
 <dl>
  <dt>Analysis</dt>
  <dd>I analyzed and pitched Blue Capital, an asset manager with $11B AUM and a YTD performance of 21%, still looking to outperform the benchmark index. Their strategy is global equities and credit, investing in businesses that they fundamentally understand and short-dated/high-yield credit instruments respectively. Blue Capital will benefit from JPMorgan’s Global Equities offerings, primarily Research with over 250 analysts focused on equity research in 24 countries covering 3500+ companies. This will aid them in finding fundamentally sound firms while assessing the macroeconomic environment to manage risk better. As well as Global Exchange, as Blue Capital looks to expand in both developed and emerging markets.</dd>

<dd>
A potential EMEA client currently has data issues with their current provider and has expressed interest in hearing about JPMorgan’s services. I pitched Global Custody, Fund Services, and Data Management respectively. JPMorgan custody platform services over $7T of assets in EMEA where the client is located, so is best placed to service the client. The data and analytics platform supports over 500 clients and offers performance measurement against benchmarks, ESG reporting, Risk Analytics, and compliance reporting and will be able to provide a consolidated view to the client.
    
</dd>
  <dt>Pitching</dt>
  <dd>Jack (a hedge fund analyst) wants to short Tiger Corp as he believes the Coronavirus will hurt earnings more than the market believes. 
Jack wants to sell 500 shares in 3 months via a futures contract. Jack wants to sell at $21.25-$21.50 as the mid-price is $22. 
    
As a market maker in this trade, we take into account trade size and direction and how that affects liquidity. The trade gets done at $21/share, with the higher spread ($1) due to liquidity challenges trying to sell in a thinly traded market in August when trade is expected to happen. The higher spread will enable the trader to find an offsetting trade to be risk-neutral (hedged). 
</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Overall, the virtual internship experience was great as JPMorgan is a big player in the global financial markets, and I got to learn more about JPMorgan, their product offerings, clients, and what a typical day-to-day is like on their Sales & Trading desk.
